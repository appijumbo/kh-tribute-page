Keir Hardie Tribute Page
------------------------
Created for the Free Code Camp course. User Story: 1) can view a tribute page with an image and text.2) can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
I rather foolishly didn't watch all the video introducing this at https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page and only when I coded the page up did I discover that we were supposed to just use Bootstrap and HTML code...oops
